# OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library

## Overview

The OpenCV project provides custom modifications to the OpenCV git repository to integrate it with VxWorks® 7. The OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning library. It includes various algorithms to recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions, track camera movements, track objects, and more.

By providing access to these modifications, this project aims to collaborate with the community and work together to upstream any custom modifications back into the OpenCV project.
